'ups declare' is running "tailor" actions.

This appears to be new behavior in ups v4_6; a ups declare should
be running the "declare" "configure" and chain actions for any
chains being declared, but it should not run "tailor".

This was discoverd on d0bbin, on an upd install of sam_bootstrap v4_0_0.
