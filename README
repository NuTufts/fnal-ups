    UPS has had a long history at Fermilab.  Many individuals from
    several groups within the Fermilab Computing Division have
    assisted in the development of ups.  Among the (now defunct) groups 
    participating in the development from the design phase on are:

        The Computing Division Online Support group (CD/OLS)

        The Computing Division User Applications Support group (CD/UAS)

        Computing Division ACCESS group.

    The software is currently maintained under the Running Experiments
    (REX) department.

                        PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                        ===================

UPS (Unix Product Support) is a Fermilab product which in its
   simplest usage provides a uniform access to entities (products)
   on all platforms.   

Ups features include support for:

        Multiple concurrent versions of products.

        Products for multiple operating systems and 
        releases in a single, ups-managed, database.

        Multiple, ups-managed, databases.

        Understanding of the concept of operating system
        and release.  Product instance selection based 
        upon OS and release.

        Inter-product dependencies.

        Automatic product startup at boot.


Ups provides the following basic command line interfaces:

        setup           Make a product instance available for use by
                        the current shell.  Perform any 
                        product specific initialization.

        unsetup         Perform the product specific 
                        de-initialization.

        ups list        List the available products.

        ups declare     Add product instance to set of ups known
                        products.

        ups undeclare   Remove a product instance from a set of
                        ups known products.

        ups modify      Modify the ups known information about
                        a product instance.


Environment Variables
---------------------

   The following environment variables are expected by all ups commands:

        PRODUCTS        A colon-delimited list of ups databases.

        UPS_SHELL       The shell family (sh or csh).

        UPS_DIR         The path to the ups product itself.


Documentation
-------------
All documentation for UPS is available at

       http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/

including the "UPS and UPD v4 Reference Manual" and instructions 
for installation and configuration.

Product Installation
--------------------
Instructions for installing ups can be found at

       http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/

In particular, in most cases we recommend installing the
bootstrap_coreFUE package, which includes ups, upd and perl.


Recompiling Ups
---------------
You will need to recompile ups if the binaries in the ups tar file 
cannot run on your system (for example, if you are running an operating
system that we do not support at Fermilab).

To rebuild ups, you should first look at the file

   ${UPS_DIR}/bin/upspremake 

and make any necessary changes/additions for your operating system.  Then,
make sure you have the UPS_DIR environmental variable set properly and
invoke "make": 

   % UPS_DIR=/path/to/ups; export UPS_DIR
   % cd UPS_DIR
   % make clean
   % make all

You may also wish to

   % make test

                        SUPPORT
                        =======

Help with the installation or use of UPS is available by sending 
mail to

                     ups_support@fnal.gov

which is auto-forwarded to the group in charge of UPS support at 
Fermilab.

This software is furnished by Fermilab on an "as is" basis as a service 
to the wider community with the goal of stimulating collaborative use 
and further development.

Provision of the software implies no commitment of support by Fermilab.

The Fermilab Computing Division is open to discussing other levels of 
support for use of the software with responsible and committed users and 
collaborators.

Use of the software in experiments at Fermilab will be assured of a 
level of support as agreed to through the standard Memorandum Of 
Understanding process.

Users may send mail to the mail address given above, with the 
expectation that it will be read and noted.
