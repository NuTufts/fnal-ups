     clone - open any minor device on a STREAMS driver

     _c_l_o_n_e is a STREAMS software driver that finds and opens an unused minor
     device on another STREAMS driver.  The minor device passed to _c_l_o_n_e
     during the open is interpreted as the major device number of another
     STREAMS driver for which an unused minor device is to be obtained.  Each
     such open results in a separate _s_t_r_e_a_m to a previously unused minor
     device.

     The _c_l_o_n_e driver consists solely of an open function.  This open function
     performs all of the necessary work so that subsequent system calls
     (including _c_l_o_s_e(2)) require no further involvement of _c_l_o_n_e.

     _c_l_o_n_e generates an ENXIO error, without opening the device, if the minor
     device number provided does not correspond to a valid major device, or if
     the driver indicated is not a STREAMS driver.

     Multiple opens of the same minor device cannot be done through the _c_l_o_n_e
     interface.  Executing _s_t_a_t(2) on the filesystem node for a cloned device
     yields a different result from executing _f_s_t_a_t(2) using a file descriptor
     obtained from opening the node.
