Things to remember to verify when reading a ups file.
=====================================================

- Better error return when reading invalid keywords,
  e.g reading 'FLAVIR' when 'FLAVOR' was expected.

- Check keyword spelling,
  e.g reading invalid keyword 'COMNEN'.

- Check delimiter in QUALIFIERS,
  e.g if any char not [0,9,a,z,A,Z] and ':' print a warning.
  
- Check that each FLAVOR is followed by a QUALIFIERS.

- Check that no VERSION is specified in a TABLE file.
