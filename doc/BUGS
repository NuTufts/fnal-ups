<ul>
<li>
On NT when an action is listed and has no functions, get a strange error.  What
happens is that when UPs outputs the '/dev/null/' (for setup /unsetup) because 
the temp file is empty (because the action was empty), NT complains.
<li>
ups declare will not declare an instance of flavor IRIX say, unless that of
flavor Linux is reachable and ok.  not good if only mounting IRIX products
disk and table file is there.
<li>
-N is not supported by ups modify.
<li>
-N is not supported by ups verify.
<li>
unsetting of UPS_COMPAT handled wrong in tmp file.  it is unset too early 
and other products may need it.
<li>
ups undeclare should either allow multiple flavors in a list or complain about
it.
</ul>
